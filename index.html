                    <p>Leafy vegetables contain many typical plant nutrients, but since they are photosynthetic tissues, their vitamin K levels are particularly notable. Phylloquinone, the most common form of the vitamin, is directly involved in photosynthesis. This causes leaf vegetables to be the primary food class that interacts significantly with the anticoagulant warfarin.We have a wide variety of Greens which include: <strong>Lettuce</strong>, <strong>Romaine Lettuce</strong>
                      , <strong>Spinach</strong>, <strong>Kale</strong>, <strong>Swiss Chards</strong>, <strong>Celery</strong> and many more! </p>

                    <p>MResearchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service have published, as of early 2014, several studies that identify the nutritional make-up and the shelf life of microgreens. Twenty-five varieties were tested, key nutrients measured were ascorbic acid (vitamin C), tocopherols (vitamin E), phylloquinone (vitamin K), and beta-carotene (a vitamin A precursor), plus other related carotenoids in the cotyledons. Our variety includes: <strong>Radicchio</strong>, <strong>Cauliflower</strong>
                      , <strong>Broccoli</strong>, <strong>Watercress</strong>, <strong>Radish</strong>, <strong>Arugula</strong> and many more!</p>

                      <strong>The Gryn-X berries</strong> are an excellent source of vitamin C and manganese and also contain decent amounts of folate (vitamin B9) and potassium.
                      Strawberries are very rich in antioxidants and plant compounds, which may have benefits for heart health and blood sugar control.Berry extracts — including those of red raspberries — block the growth of and destroy cancer cells in test-tube studies on colon, prostate, breast and oral (mouth) cancer cells
